But not time passage is associated to these ops. NYTProf is too heavy and too much on statements timings and replacing pp_funcs. I want opcode timings ( min, max, avg, maybe min2, max2 to see the spread between.the randomness) with mach_absolute_time/QueryPerformanceCounter resolution. Should B::Stats have such feature this?","files":null}]}
